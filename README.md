# MobilePWAAppSample
Sample video of PWA Mobile App on iOS

This is a basic PWA Mobile app I created for an aesthetic medical company, This app was used as a guide and treatment monitoring app for patients. This sample video is running on IOS but as its a PWA app can run on android as well.

The backend of this app I also created using NodeJS and a MySQL server developing a API using json to talk to frontend.
